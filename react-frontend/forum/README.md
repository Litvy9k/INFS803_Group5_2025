## Getting Started

First, install dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

OR make a production build with:
```bash
npm run build
```
then run the server:
```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


# Backend integration
The backend url domain should be changed in **src/backendDomain.js** to correctly connect frontend to backend.
